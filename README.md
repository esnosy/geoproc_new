My geometry processing research code

- Primitive/Primitive intersection: intersection.hpp/cpp
- Mesh file formats IO: mesh_io.hpp/cpp
- Surface area uniform sampling of triangle mesh surfaces: sample_surface.cpp
- Rejection sampling of points in the volume bounded by a triangle mesh surface: sample_volume.cpp
